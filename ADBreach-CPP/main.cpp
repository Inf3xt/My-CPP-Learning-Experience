=================================================================================

This file will hopefully allow me to excel in my current C++ understanding.
I am remaking my tool I made in Python and porting it to this beautiful language.

Enjoy some code that will make you cringe. :D

Note: As Python and C++ are different languages, their packages are different ofc.
It will NOT be an exact clone, it will be a sort of a remake in this.

TODO:
- port this to js
- port this to c#
